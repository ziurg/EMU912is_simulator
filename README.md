# EMU912is_simulator
Simulate an EMU912 on rpi

This project aim to reproduce an EMU912is interface, in order to be integrated on a DR400's cockpit simulator.
The program should run on a rpi and will interact with external switchs connected on GPIO (or using an arduino).

The IHM will be develloped on js, and will be run at startup (rpi in kiosk mode).
